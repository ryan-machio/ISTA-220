1. A method is a sequence of statements.
  accepts values outside and returns values to the outside
1. A function returns a value where it can only have input parameters.
  A procedure can have input/output parameters.
  Functions returning no value are called sub procedures.
  Subroutines do not need to return data, as functions do.
1. Return statements terminate the execution of a function and returns control
to the calling function.
1. An expression-bodied method consists of a single expression that returns a value whose type matches the method's return type, or, for methods that return void, that performs some operation.
1. Scope is an enclosing context or region that defines where a name can be used without qualification.
1. Overloading is what happens when you have two methods with the same name but different signatures.  At compile time, the compiler works sout which one it's going to call, based on the compile time types of the arugments and the target of the method call.
1. The value of each argument much be compatible with the type of it's corresponding parameters.
1. You write a method by writing your parameters within a parentheses.
1. Optional parameters are specified by including the paramters default value in the method definition.
1. You write the named parameters which introduce extra local variables and assignments before passing the arguments.
1. You must include a return statement at the end of the body.
  No, you cannot return more than one value.
1. At compile time, the compiler looks at the types of the arguments you are passing in and
then arranges for your application to call the version of the method that has a matching set of parameters.
