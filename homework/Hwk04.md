1. Possible values of a boolean expression are true or false.
1. ==, !=, <, <=, =>, >, ||, &&
1. Short circuit operators don't necessarily evaluate all of the operands.
1. If the left side of an && operand is true, the operation will always evaluate to true, no matter the right side operand.  This also applies if the left operand evaluates to false.  If the left side of an || operator is true, then the program will automatically evaluate to true.  However, if it is false, the program will test the right side to see if it is true.  This occurs vice versa.
1. When using curly braces in an if-else statement, consider scope.  The curly braces group a set of statement and deceleration in the if-then statement.
1. Using multiple lines of code within the curly braces of an if-statement will run the lines of code if the if/else-statement is satisfied.
1. Break finishes the program and the program continues at the first statement that follows the closing brace of the switch statement.
1. A recursive method is a method that calls itself.  i.e. Math example: : a1 = 10; an = an-1+ 5
1. a. These are the same because the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.
b. These are the same because the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.
