1. A class is an act of classification where information is systematically arranged.
1. 1 - To combine methods and data within a class; to support classification.
   2 - To control the accessibility of the methods and data; in other words, to control the use of the class.
1. You must first create a variable and then initialize it by using the keyword new.  I.e., you have a class circle and you want to use it in another class you would assign the class's namespace within the class you are trying to instantiate it in; Circle c; c = new Circle;
new goes to the heap and allocates sufficient memory to hold an object of that size and returns a memory address to the stack.
1. The default access and fields of a class are always private.  You can change the default by initializing the field within the method before it's declaration (i.e. public)
1. To write a constructor, you would add a public type that does not return a value and give it the same name as the class
when using new, it calls the constructor of a class, not the class
1. Instance: Methods that operate on data belonging to a particular instance of a class.
   Fields:
1. You would make the class public in the case you want other classes to refer to hit.
1. When using query expressions.
1. Polymorphism describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface.
1. Message passing is a technique for invoking behavior on a computer.
1. Simula
1. Alexander Stephanov is a Russian-American computer programmer, known as the advocate of generic programming and as the primary designer and implementer of the C++ standard template library.  His quote means that not everyone agrees with OOP.
