1. A compound assignment operator has a shorter syntax to assign the result.  The operation is performed on two operands before the result is assigned to the first operand.
1. +=, -=. *=, /=, %=, &=, |=. ^=, <<=. >>=, =>
1. ++5, +5, --50, -50
1. Until the loop reaches a solution
1. The variable that changes each time the loop executs
1. The while loop will continue to execute.
1. Three parts.  You can omit any of three parts.  You can omit any of them.  If you omit all of them you must use a break statement to terminate the loop.
1. You use a do-while loop, which says "loop while conidition is true, and execute this block of code."
1. Break exits the loop immediately and execution continues at the first statement that follows the loop.
1. Continue causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately after reevaluating the boolean expression.
1.  You would use an infinite loop when the code must execute each time.
